# Leveraging Machine Learning for Human Pose Recognition

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize human poses from two types of datasets: **images** and **videos**. The system detects key points of the human body, enabling pose analysis and activity recognition.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

Human pose recognition is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from sports analytics to healthcare. This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach to detect, analyze, and recognize human poses in both static images and dynamic video sequences.

### Features:
- **Image Processing**: Analyze static images for pose estimation.
- **Video Processing**: Detect and track poses in video sequences.
- **Activity Recognition**: Classify actions like standing, running, and sitting.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application for dataset analysis.
